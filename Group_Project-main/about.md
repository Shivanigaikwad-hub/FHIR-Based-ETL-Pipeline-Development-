## About Our Team
We are a group of three graduate students passionate about applying technical skills to solve real-world challenges in healthcare. This project gave us the opportunity to explore the power of ETL pipelines and FHIR APIs in enabling healthcare data interoperability. Together, we combined our skills in coding, design, and project management to build a robust and efficient solution.
